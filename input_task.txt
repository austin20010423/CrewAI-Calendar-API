Objective: Create a Python program that processes student scores to determine a final grade. This task tests your understanding of lists, functions, and conditional logic.
Instructions:
Input: Prompt the user to enter five distinct assignment scores (0–100). Store these values in a list.
Logic: Write a function called calculate_grade that takes this list as an argument. Inside the function, calculate the average score.
Conditionals: Use if-elif-else statements to assign a letter grade based on the average (e.g., A for 90+, B for 80+, etc.).
Output: Print the calculated average (rounded to two decimal places) and the corresponding letter grade to the console.
Success Criteria: The program handles invalid inputs gracefully and accurately converts numerical data into categorical grades.
